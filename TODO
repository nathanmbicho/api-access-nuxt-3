- ROUTES
All goes in pages folder
- routes are files based
./pages/about.vue - url/about

- nested routes
files inside another file
./pages/about.vue - url/about
but has ./pages/about/company-profile.vue

HMR - Hot Model Reloading - updates as changes are being made

we use <NuxtPage /> on the parent file about.vue, which will get anything inside about folder and fill in the <NuxtPage />

- dynamic routes
routes based on params
./pages/contact/[contactNameSlug].vue - url/contact/nathan-mbicho, - url/contact/eliakim-matutu
./pages/contact/[contactNameSlug]/work/[workPlace].vue  - url/contact/nathan-mbicho/work/safaricom-plc
./pages/contact-[contactNameSlug]/work-[workPlace].vue - url/contact-eliakim-matutu/work-just-good-tech
./pages/[contactNameSlug]-[workPlace].vue - url/eliakimmatutu-justgoodtech (careful with separating object)

to read the params in file {{ $route.params.contactNameSlug }}, {{ $route.params.workPlace }}
- $route.params.slugName

optional route params - (we use double brackets)
./pages/contact/[contactNameSlug]/[[workPlace]].vue  - url/contact/nathan-mbicho or  url/contact/nathan-mbicho/safaricom-plc

COMPOSABLES
- A reusable piece of logic that uses vue's reactivity system. Better way to organize our logic and use it in multiple components.
They are names using use[Name] to diff from regular methods

Utils - If it doesn't use refs, computer props, watchers, or any other vue logic, its just a regular js function
